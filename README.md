# Employee Attrition and Organizational Factors - EDA

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee attrition and identify key organizational factors influencing employees' decisions to leave. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover trends, correlations, and insights that can help organizations improve employee retention strategies.

## üìÇ Dataset
**Dataset Description:**
- The dataset includes demographic, job-related, and satisfaction-related features for employees.
- The target variable **Attrition** (1 = Left, 0 = Stayed) indicates whether an employee has left the organization.

### **Key Features:**
- **Employee Information:** EmployeeID, Age, Gender
- **Job Information:** Department, Job Role, Years at Company, Monthly Income
- **Work Satisfaction:** Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance
- **Training & Performance:** Training Times Last Year, Performance Rating, Overtime
- **Education:** Education Level

## üõ†Ô∏è EDA Process
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data types.
- Encoded categorical variables where necessary.

### Univariate Analysis**
- Distribution of numerical features (histograms).
- Frequency distribution of categorical features (bar charts, pie charts).

### Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
- Correlation matrix to identify feature relationships.
- Employee attrition trends based on age, salary, department, job role, and satisfaction levels.

## üîç Key Insights
- Employees with **low job satisfaction** and **poor work-life balance** are more likely to leave.
- Certain **departments and job roles** experience higher attrition rates.
- Employees with **longer tenure** and **higher monthly income** are less likely to leave.
- Overtime work and performance rating may have an impact on attrition.

## üìä Visualizations
- Attrition distribution across departments.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Feature importance in predicting attrition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook


# Inspired by real-world HR analytics problems.
